Starting from Visual Studio, Microsoft has added Bootstrap as the default user interface framework through a NuGet package. So, 
bootstrap will be automatically added to your project, if you choose the ASP.NET Web Forms (.NET Framework) template. But the default bootstrap which 
comes with it will be of older version, say 3.0.0. You have to upgrade the Bootstrap NuGet package to add the latest version of bootstrap to your Web Forms project.
